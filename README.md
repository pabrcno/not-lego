# 🧱 Not LEGO

> A browser-based 3D brick building experience that's definitely, totally, legally distinct from those other building blocks.

## ✨ What is this?

**Not LEGO** is an interactive 3D building experience that brings the joy of brick-by-brick construction to your browser with **realistic physics simulation**. Watch your bricks fall, stack, and settle naturally as gravity and collision detection bring your creations to life. Build structures that obey the laws of physics - balance matters, stability is key, and every brick placement feels satisfyingly real. No instruction manual required!

## 🎮 Controls

Building is easy! Just use your keyboard:

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `1` | Add brick type 1 |
| `2` | Add brick type 2 |
| `3` | Add brick type 3 |
| `A` | Rotate left |
| `D` | Rotate right |

## 🚀 Features

- **Real-time physics simulation** - Experience authentic gravity, momentum, and collision detection
- **Dynamic brick interactions** - Watch bricks tumble, stack, and stabilize naturally
- **Multiple brick types** - Choose from different brick sizes and shapes
- **Intuitive rotation** - Precisely position your bricks before they drop
- **Browser-based** - No installation needed, just open and build
- **Responsive controls** - Smooth, keyboard-driven building experience
- **Realistic stacking** - Build structures that follow the laws of physics

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

This project leverages modern web technologies to deliver a smooth 3D building experience:

- **Three.js** - For stunning 3D graphics and physics
- **WebGL** - Hardware-accelerated rendering
- **Vanilla JavaScript** - Clean, performant code

## 📦 Getting Started

### Play Now

The easiest way to start building is to visit the [live demo](https://pabrcno.github.io/not-lego/).

### Run Locally

Want to tinker with the code? Clone and run:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/pabrcno/not-lego.git

# Navigate to the project
cd not-lego

# Open in your browser
# Simply open index.html in your favorite browser
# Or use a local server:
python -m http.server 8000
# Then visit http://localhost:8000
```

## 🎯 Roadmap

Ideas for future enhancements:

- [ ] Save and load creations
- [ ] More brick types and colors
- [ ] Multiplayer building mode
- [ ] Export to 3D file formats
- [ ] Mobile touch controls
- [ ] Building gallery/showcase

## 🤝 Contributing

## 🎨 Building Tips

1. **Start with a foundation** - Use larger bricks (type 3) for your base
2. **Plan your rotation** - Think about brick orientation before placing
3. **Layer strategically** - Build up gradually for more stable structures
4. **Experiment freely** - There's no wrong way to build!
